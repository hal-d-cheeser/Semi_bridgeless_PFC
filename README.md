# Semi_bridgeless_PFC
This includes a code for a semi bridgeless PFC using a PIC microcontroller

PIC24FJ Interleaved boost converter

This project uses a PIC24FJ64GA002 for a Semi Bridgeless PFC

The main code is situated in the tmr1.c file

It is a basic PID controller

In this code, there is a lot of room for improvement
